## How we built it

- **Next.js and Next UI** : These tools provided the framework and UI components to build a responsive and visually appealing front-end for WealthWise. Next.js offered server-side rendering and static site generation to enhance performance and SEO, while Next UI delivered a comprehensive kit of design elements for a cohesive user interface.
- **Auth0** : This service was integral for implementing robust authentication and authorization processes, ensuring that user data remains secure and access is controlled and monitored.
- **Typescript** : Adopting TypeScript enabled us to leverage strong typing and compile-time checks, reducing runtime errors and improving the maintainability of our codebase.
- **ModalAI** : The Large Language Model was a critical component, offering personalized financial insights by analyzing user data. It enabled the core functionality that differentiates WealthWise in the market.
- **MongoDB** : We used MongoDB for its scalability and flexibility in handling diverse data types, facilitating efficient data storage, retrieval, and management for user profiles and transaction data.
- **Verbwire** : In order to ensure the privacy of our users we stored credit card information on the block chain, making sure that those details were securely uploaded.
- **.tech Domain** : Choosing a .tech domain highlighted our focus on technology and innovation, providing a relevant and brand-aligned internet presence.
